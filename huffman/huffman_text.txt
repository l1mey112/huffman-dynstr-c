Return Value
The total number of elements successfully read are returned as a size_t object, which is an integral data type. If this number differs from the nmemb parameter, then either an error had occurred or the End Of File was reached.

Example
The following example shows the usage of fread() function.

 Live Demo
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main () {
   FILE *fp;
   char c[] = "this is tutorialspoint";
   char buffer[100];

   /* Open file for both reading and writing */
   fp = fopen("file.txt", "w+");

   /* Write data to the file */
   fwrite(c, strlen(c) + 1, 1, fp);

   /* Seek to the beginning of the file */
   fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_SET);

   /* Read and display data */
   fread(buffer, strlen(c)+1, 1, fp);
   printf("%s\n", buffer);
   fclose(fp);
   
   return(0);
}
Let us compile and run the above program that will create a file file.txt and write a content this is tutorialspoint. After that, we use fseek() function to reset writing pointer to the beginning of the file and prepare the file content which is as follows âˆ’

this is tutorialspoint
